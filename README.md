- 👋 Hi, I’m Michaela.
- 👀 I’m interested in career change. I have always wanted to become a coder, but some life challenges didn't allow me to.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python language. In the past, I have modified scripts for Ultima Online and went through the basics of SQL, sooo I have some basics.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to hear if you would be interested in helping me with the learning process.
